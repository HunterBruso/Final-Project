**Summary**

In this project, we are interested in the Netflix database, mostly because we use it every day. With this project, we wanted to analyze the rating description to the user rating score that can be found in the netflixShows.csv. We are interested in this analysis because we wanted see how user ratings stand up to the rating description. We believe that user ratings are more important than rating descriptions and want to see how they are affected.
